# Policy Machine Protos

This repository contains the Protocol Buffer definitions for the NIST Policy Machine.

Protocol buffers are Googleâ€™s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Learn more in the [Protocol Buffers documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).

The generated Java code from these definitions can be found in the [policy-machine-core](https://github.com/usnistgov/policy-machine-core) repository.
