# Policy Machine Protos

This repository contains the Protocol Buffer (`.proto`) definitions for the NIST Policy Machine.

Protocol Buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. The definitions in this repository are used to generate client and server code for the various services that comprise the Policy Machine.

The generated Java code from these definitions can be found in the [policy-machine-core](https://github.com/usnistgov/policy-machine-core) repository.
